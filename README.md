# sshkey.py
Deploy your ssh public key in a easier way
## TODO ##
# Improve script functions, by trimming the code. (I'm still learning python)
# Fail tests and stdout to workaround any kind of problem deploying key


1) Set your ssh key URL in the script.
2) Host your script anywhere you would like to.
3) Run by typing in shell: curl http://anywhereyoulike.com/sshpub.py | python -
4) Be happy not using root/password anymore.
